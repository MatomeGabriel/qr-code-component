## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on the project I learned to use HTML elements with semantic meaning, I also learned to use css variable, css resposive units(rems) etc.

Here are few examples:

```html
<article>
  <h1>Heading required</h1>
</article>
```

```css
:root {
  --slate-300: #d5e1ef;
}

html {
  /* Set the font size to 10px, (10/16)*100 = 62.5% */
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
.heading {
  font-size: 3.6rem;
  /* Using the css variable */
  background-color: var(--slate-300);
}
```

### Continued development

In the futire I'll focus on mastering front end development, including getting comfortable working with front end frameworks and libraries such as html, css, vanilla javascript, react, and more.
